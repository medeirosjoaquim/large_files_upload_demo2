Before start, on the api, change the value of the local upload directory (the current one works only on Windows)
```const tmpDir = 'C:\\tmp'```


 
 - Run the server on api folder: 


 ```npm install```
 
 
 ```node index.js```

 - Run the webapp on api folder:


 ```npm install```
 
 
 ```npm run start```

The final result will be on the tmpDir folder but, for the moment, it's without file format. So you need
to choose the proper program to open the file.
